        <h2 class="homepara">Tau Kappa Epsilon was the first fraternity on IUPUI's campus and has been here since 2005.
            Since then, our chapter has achieved countless awards from our campus and from our national headquarters.
            These include awards for philanthropy, grades, top fraternity on campus, ranked as one of the top 10 TKE chapters
            in the nation, and member size.  We are a family of brothers that is built off of Love, Charity, and Esteem.
            If it were not for these three qualites, we would not be where we are today.  Many students have joined us and
            lefts as better men, for a better world.  Whether you have heard of us or not, we are proud to be on our campus
            and to be able to do everything that we do for not only Tau Kappa Epsilon, but everyone on our campus.

            My purpose for making this website is inform people on why Tau Kappa Epsilon is the best fraternity that we
            have on our campus.  This website will be used for everything from explaing what we are and what we stand for,
            our brotherhood, our networking system, and everything that TKE has done for me since I joined in the Fall of 2019.
            From meeting so many amazing new people to traveling around the country for our leadership events.
